### Data Used

To perform exploration of COVID-19 data in Mecklenburg county, I created my own dataset, "weekly_covid19_report_mecknc.csv"
The Data in this dataset was based on the Mecknc.gov COVID-19 reports from [Mecklenburg County COVID-19 Data Releases](https://www.mecknc.gov/news/Pages/COVID-19-Data-Dashboard.aspx)<br>
The reports in this site are in PDF format, so I had to pull the data manually. <br> 
This dataset does not update automatically.<br> Dataset was last updated on 2020-12-27.
